Variables allowus to store information. We tell our computer to set aside some space to hol that information so we can retrieve it later. A variable is the lcoation where the information resides, when we need it we know where to look. Use snake_case, and it's a container whose value is what's stored inside of it.
Have in mind in your programs what type of data a variable is storing (string or integer). The equsls sign is "assigning" the value.
calling a method on a set variable won't change it unless you do something like variable.destroy!

Interpolation:
This is to reference something, or pass a value through that has been given in the form of a variable, like a fill-in-the-blank. It interpolates(or renders) a variable into a string.
You pass in arguments to make code more reusable and abstract. An argument is a placeholder. An argument in the definition will make it requeired whenever using this method.
Naming variables need to be descriptive and concise. Scope means that not all variables exists everywhere in a program so that they con't be overwritten.
You can't define a variable outside of a method and think it will work within a method (would have to use an instance or class var instead)
