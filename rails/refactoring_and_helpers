software architecture - overall ease of change, avoidance of bugs, design decisions.

Separation of Concerns:
View - end user experience on a website in browser. what they read, click, see in a flash, and hear. "interface"
Model - where the data resides and is altered
Controller - manages communication between these two.

The user requests data by clicking or submitting and entering a URL in the browser. The request is sent to the server.
The controller sasks the model to provide data depending on request.
The model accesses or manipulates the data from database and returns result to controller.
The controller sends the response back to user, presented by views.

If you want a new design (smartphone accessibility, an app that talks to you, etc), you only need to make a new "view", not change code.
You don't want to introduce bugs to the existing model and controller code.

A helper's concern is limited, and the view will be responsible for telling whether a local or instance variable should be used. Helpers don't need to know that, to keep it bastract.

Application Helper is often where you would put method for current_user because it's used in almost every view.

"Title" can be a broad term in a view, so we can use Application Helper so that it can be used ny a post or author view.
