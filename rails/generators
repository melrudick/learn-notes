Rails Generators:
If the task is matched for using one, use it. Generators create a lot of code and if you're not going to use it, it will confuse your app.

rails g <name of generator> <options> --no-test-framework

the last is a flag that tells the gen not to create tests for newly generated models etc. Don't need the fag on your own rails app. only for Learn because tests already exist.

migrations - to add a column to an existing table, now we can write:
  rails g migration add_published_status_to_posts published_status:string --no.. (if learn)
now run rake db:migrate
-if you made a mistake and want to remove it, run:
  rails g migration remove_published_status_from_posts, and then the rest of the line
-if you wrote string, but it actually needed to be boolean, you can write:
  rails g migration change_post_status_data_type_to_posts post_status:boolean
  now you will have to manually write in the change_column :posts, :post_status, :string and run rake db:migrate

models - use this one regularly.
  rails g model Author name:string genre:string bio:text
this makes an app/models.author.rb
run rake db:migrate and it will add table to database schema
-now you can test this in the console by creating a new author with all of the attributes

controllers - great for static views or non-CRUD features.
  rails g controller admin dashboard stats financials settings
this creates a ton of code. it creates a controller and routes for each argument, a all view templates, js file, css. there are better options for CRUD functionality.

resource - if building an API, using a front end MVC framework, or creating views, this is great for code.
  rails g resource Account name:string payment_status:string
migration file, model, conroller, view with no template files, js, css, a resources call in routes.rb

if yuo run rake routes | grep account
you'll see all of the routes, but you can add in the ones you want into the controller.
