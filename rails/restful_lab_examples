your StudentController class will now define methods that are your routes:
def index
  @student = Student.all
end
then in your view for index:
<h1>All Students</h1>
<% @students.each do |student| %>
  <li><%= student.first_name %><%= student.last_name %></li>
<% end %>
you have already defined class Student method to_s to have first_name and last_name
and in your routes.rb in config:
get 'students' to 'students#index'
 In dynamic routes, we make some changes:
/welcome path will always show the welcome page.. it is static. dynamic routes will render different data based on the parameters passed in. When 42 is passed in to /posts/:id, the app should render the data for the post of 42.
we started with
  get 'posts/:id', to: 'posts#show'
make sure there is a show method in the PostsController (@post = Post.find(params[:id]) and a show.html.erb with the rendered parameters for a view.
We can change the get route to a restful resource method. we can use 'only' if we only want the show action.
  resources :posts, only: :show
*** still very unclear about what this is and why it's different/better than the first line.

resources :students, only: [:index, :show]
