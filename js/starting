data types can be found by writing: typeof() -accepts one arg
you can have numbers, strings, objexts, symbols, null, undefined
don't need float, all numbers are number, even infinity
string - '', "", ``
collections are like hashes, in curly brackets, refer to objects
Null is an intentionally absent object. will return "object"
undefined means not yet assigned a value
primitive is for a single value

const, let, var
mist camelCase your variables
first you declare a variable, var pi;
then it is stored
then assign a value, pi = 3.14159;
one line, var pi = 3.14159;
don't declare and not assign a variable
let won't let you reassign a variable
unless you leave out the "let", different from "var"
